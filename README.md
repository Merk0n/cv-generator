# CV-GENERATOR
This project is a CV (Curriculum Vitae) generator built using React and styled with CSS. The CV generator comprises two primary components: the control section and the visualization section. Within the control section, users can input, modify, or remove their details. Any information entered here instantly reflects in the visualization section. Upon completion, users can conveniently download their CV in PDF with proper formatting.
